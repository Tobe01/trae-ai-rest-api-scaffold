# Trae AI REST API Scaffold

This project shows how an **AI-native IDE (Trae)** can help scaffold a simple REST API in two ways:
- **Inline completions** while typing  
- **Chat-based generation** through AI prompts  

The API has just two endpoints:  
- `GET /items` → fetch items  
- `POST /items` → add new items  

The goal is to explore how AI tools like Trae can make building software faster and easier for developers.
