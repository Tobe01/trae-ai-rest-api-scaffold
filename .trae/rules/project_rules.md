# Project Rules (Tobe-Ai-Developer)

- All code examples should use JavaScript (Node.js + Express for backend, React for frontend).
- Use MongoDB as the database by default unless specified otherwise.
- Assume I’m working in a Windows environment.
- Code should follow clean coding practices (clear variable names, comments where needed).
- Always explain how a code snippet integrates into the existing project structure.
- When debugging, first restate the error in plain language, then propose fixes step by step.
- Keep solutions minimal — avoid adding unnecessary dependencies unless critical.
- If multiple solutions exist, compare trade-offs before suggesting one.
